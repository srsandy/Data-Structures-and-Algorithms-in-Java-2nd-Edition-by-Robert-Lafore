# Maximum Element
**Problem from Hackerrank**

You have an empty sequence, and you will be given **N** queries. Each query is one of these three types:

1. Push the element `x` into the stack.
2. Delete the element present at the top of the stack.
3. Print the maximum element in the stack.

The first line of input contains an integer, `N` . The next `N` lines each contain an above mentioned query. (It is guaranteed that each query is valid.)

### **Example**

**Input**: 

``` java
    10
    1 97
    2
    1 20
    2
    1 26
    1 20
    2
    3
    1 91
    3
```
   
**Output:**: 

``` java
   26
   91
```
