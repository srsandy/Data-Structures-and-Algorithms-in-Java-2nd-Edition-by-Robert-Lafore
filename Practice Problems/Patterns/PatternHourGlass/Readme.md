Take N as input. For a value of N=5, we wish to draw the following pattern :

                          5 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5
                            4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 
                              3 2 1 0 1 2 3 
                                2 1 0 1 2 
                                  1 0 1 
                                    0 
                                  1 0 1 
                                2 1 0 1 2 
                              3 2 1 0 1 2 3 
                            4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4
