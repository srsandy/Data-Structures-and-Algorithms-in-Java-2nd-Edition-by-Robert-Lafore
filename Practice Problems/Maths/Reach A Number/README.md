# React A Number

**Problem from PrepBytes**

Given a number `N`, write a program to find the least number of operations required to reach `N` from **ZERO**, using following opreations only:
 - Double the number 
 - Add one to the number

### Example:
**Input** : `6`

**Output:** : `4`

**Explanation** :  As the input is `6`. 

We start from 0 add one to it than the results is 1 (step 1) <br>
then add one to 1 it that results in 2 (step 2). <br>
then add one to 2 it that results in 3 (step 3). <br>
then we double the number 3 that results in 6 (step 4). <br> Hence `4` is the answer.
