# My Sqrt

**Problem from LeetCode**

Implement int sqrt(int x).

Compute and return the square root of x, where x is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the result is returned.

### Example:

*E.g - 1*

**Input** : `4`

**Output:** : `2`


*E.g - 2*

**Input** : `8`

**Output:** : `2`

**Explanation** : The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
